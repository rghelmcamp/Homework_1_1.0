# Unit 16 Assignment - Live Webpages

### Background

Congratulations on learning HTML, CSS, and Git! You're well on your way to adding more skills to your arsenal. 

Now it's time to put those skills to work and create a live webpage. You will be creating your very own frontend search page like Google or Bing! Don't worry, it will not have to have the functionality of a search engine.

In this homework assignment, you will accomplishing three main tasks:

  1. Making a Github repository

  2. Cloning the repository to your computer

  3. Creating a folder structure

  4. Making a search engine frontend page

  5. Deploying to Github Pages

This will be one of your harder assignments, if only because you're just getting your feet wet in web design. Trust us, though; it will get easier. Invest your time in this assignment, and it will pay dividends!

### Instructions

1. Create a GitHub repository 

   - The repository has to be public

   - Make sure to include a README.md file

2. Clone Repository

   - Clone the repository to your computer

   - If you are feeling stuck with this, ask a TA

3. Create a folder structure

   - Create a `index.html`

   - Create a `css` folder

     - Inside create a `style.css` file

   - Create a `images` folder

     - If you have Images

4. Make a search engine frontend page

   - Take a look at existing search engines:

     - [Google](https://www.google.com/)

     - [Bing!](https://www.bing.com/)

     - [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)

   - Get some inspiration from how these other search engines are designed

   - Design how you would want your search page to look!

   - A few requirements:

     - In the appropriate spots, page must have :

       - `<nav>` tag

       - `<article>` tag

       - `<section>` tag

       - `<aside>` tag

     - Have a search box for the user to search

         - **Remember!** No functionality is required!

         - A user will not actually be performing a search

         - In the future, JavaScript will allow us to perform a task such as this

     - Use your UX/UI skills!

5. Deploy to Github Pages

   - Deploy your finished assignment to GitHub Pages.
